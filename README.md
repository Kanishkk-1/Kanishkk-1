Hey, I'm Kanishk. This is my digital dumping ground where I throw random thoughts and occasionally something useful surfaces.

I survive on way too much coffee and spite (mostly spite), plus whatever energy drink is on sale. Right now I'm in a committed relationship with my computer, though it's pretty one sided so far. I have this weird obsession with collecting bugs in my code honestly at this point it's like Pokemon but significantly more frustrating. Also GUIs and I have serious beef.

My code is actually pretty clean (Marie Kondo would approve). I've got this growing pile of books that judge me silently while I put on whatever music matches my current chaos level and pretend I'm totally nailing this whole "productivity" thing. When my brain starts melting from too much screen time, I escape on my bike. Or binge whatever series I'm currently obsessed with. Both are equally valid coping mechanisms for navigating the endless stream of first world problems I've somehow made my career.
